## 7. Delivery and Acceptance
Terms regarding the delivery of the yachts will include dates, locations, and conditions for acceptance.

## 8. Insurance Requirements
The Principal shall secure comprehensive marine insurance coverage for the yachts, which shall include but not be limited to liability, damage, loss, and environmental damage insurance.

The policy limits shall be sufficient to cover the full replacement value of the yachts and any liability arising from their operation.

- Responsibilities include:
  - Developing and adhering to comprehensive maintenance schedules.
  - Conducting timely repairs.
  - Implementing preventative measures to prevent wear and tear.
- Navigare will make all reasonable efforts to diligently maintain and care for the yachts, aiming to maximize revenue potential and preserve their long-term value, thereby minimizing costs related to depreciation or significant repairs at the end of the contract term.
- Additionally, Navigare acknowledges the Principal's right to appoint an independent third-party surveyor for annual inspections of each yacht during its haul-out period.
- Navigare will notify the Principal in advance of the scheduled haul-out periods to allow for the organization of these inspections.
- The Principal will bear the costs of these inspections.
- Navigare's cooperation is crucial to ensure the yachts meet the agreed-upon maintenance standards and to provide the Principal with confidence in their condition.

## 12. Revenue Calculation, Distribution, and Audit Rights
Revenue from charter operations, after deducting operational costs, will be allocated with 75% accruing to the Principal and 25% to Navigare. Operational costs include expenses for crew salaries, maintenance, repairs, fuel, insurance, and other costs directly related to yacht operations.

The Principal reserves the right to audit financial statements, operational records, and documents pertinent to revenue calculation and cost deductions. Audits may be conducted by an independent auditor appointed by the Principal with reasonable notice to Navigare.

Navigare agrees to maintain clear and detailed records of all income and expenditures, available to the Principal or the appointed auditor upon request. The Principal will receive monthly financial reports within fifteen (15) days following the end of each month, including a comprehensive breakdown of revenues and costs.

Discrepancies found during audits or financial report reviews will be promptly addressed, with adjustments made to future revenue distributions to correct any errors.

## 13. Profit Distribution Schedule
Profit distribution will occur quarterly, with payments made within 30 days following the quarter's end. The projected monthly payment per vessel is approximately USD 14,000, assuming at least 31 weeks of booked charters per year. Detailed financial statements will accompany each payment.

If booked charters per vessel fall below 31 weeks in any year, a revised profit distribution schedule may be negotiated. Surplus revenue will be distributed quarterly, with 75% to the Principal and 25% to Navigare, after reserving funds for unexpected expenses or future investments.

A reserve fund will be established to cover unforeseen operational costs or emergency repairs, with annual contributions determined by the previous year's financial performance and projected needs.

Profit distribution is subject to an annual review, with adjustments made by mutual consent and documented in a signed addendum to this MoU.

Payments will be made via bank transfer to an account designated by the Principal. Navigare will ensure compliance with international banking regulations and anti-money laundering standards.

Navigare will provide the Principal with access to an online portal for real-time financial data monitoring.

## 14. Default and Remedies
In the event of a default, including failure to meet operational standards, late payments, or breach of MoU terms, the non-defaulting party will provide written notice to the defaulting party, allowing a thirty (30) day cure period.

If the default is not remedied within the cure period, the non-defaulting party may pursue remedies including MoU termination, legal proceedings, withholding payments, or other lawful remedies.

The parties may agree to extend the cure period or waive the default in writing. Rights and remedies are cumulative and do not preclude seeking other legal remedies.

Parties will act in good faith to amicably resolve defaults before resorting to legal proceedings.
