## Overview

#### In light of inflationary pressures, looming recession risks, and global tensions, the conventional portfolio allocation of 60% equities and 40% fixed income may no longer suffice for achieving long-term investment objectives.

-   Stable Income: Seeks to generate quarterly income at a rate above inflation and traditional fixed income.
    
-   Principal Return: Investors are guaranteed to receive their principal back in full at the end of the term, independent of the fund's performance.
    
-   Diversified Portfolio: Each portfolio includes three different income notes tied to three different stocks, allowing investors to diversify their risk.
    
-   Diligent Investment Approach: Income structured notes are purchased based on a transparent process that requires each underlying stock to meet certain criteria, which is expected to minimize the likelihood of any significant price decline.
